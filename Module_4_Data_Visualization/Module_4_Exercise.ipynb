    "# Data Visualization Exercise\n",

    "For this exercise, use your creativity and understanding of the different concepts of data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a plot (or a series of subplots) from whatever dataset you choose. As much as possible, please choose a dataset of relevance for visual storytelling. Make the plot using `python`. It doesn't matter if you choose to use `matplotlib` or `seaborn`. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the submission:\n",
    "1. Upload the code that generates the plot to your GitHub repository or to Google Classroom (whichever method you're using for submissions).\n",
    "2. Upload a png file of the visualization to Google Classroom and write in the Private Comments the caption for the figure you submitted.\n",
    "3. Make sure to provide the data source in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make an effort to make it a good and compelling graphic. Choose your colors according to the type of data you're visualizing. Make sure to label everything and avoid clutter. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reference for color choices, you can go to [CARTOColors](https://carto.com/carto-colors/). Simply click on the color map of your choice and it will copy the HEX code of the color."
